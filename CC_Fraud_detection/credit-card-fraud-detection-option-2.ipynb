We could assing cost to misclassifications, but being interested in classifying \"1s\" correctly, the cost for misclassifying \"1s\" should be bigger than \"0\" misclassifications. After that, the algorithm would select the threshold which minimises the total cost. A drawback I see is that we have to manually select the weight of each cost... therefore, I will leave this know as a thought.\n- Going back to the threshold changing, there is an option which is the Precisio-Recall curve. By visually seeing the performance of the model depending on the threshold we choose, we can investigate a sweet spot where recall is high enough whilst keeping a high precision value.\n\n### Investigate Precision-Recall curve and area under this curve.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cdf08467-7947-a71b-3d00-7b060905bbdb"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from itertools import cycle\n\nlr = LogisticRegression(C = 0.01, penalty = 'l1')\nlr.fit(X_train_undersample,y_train_undersample.values.ravel())\ny_pred_undersample_proba = lr.predict_proba(X_test_undersample.values)\n\nthresholds = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9]\ncolors = cycle(['navy', 'turquoise', 'darkorange', 'cornflowerblue', 'teal', 'red', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue','black'])\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,5))\n\nj = 1\nfor i,color in zip(thresholds,colors):\n    y_test_predictions_prob = y_pred_undersample_proba[:,1] > i\n    \n    precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_test_undersample,y_test_predictions_prob)\n    \n    # Plot Precision-Recall curve\n    plt.plot(recall, precision, color=color,\n                 label='Threshold: %s'%i)\n    plt.xlabel('Recall')\n    plt.ylabel('Precision')\n    plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])\n    plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])\n    plt.title('Precision-Recall example')\n    plt.legend(loc=\"lower left\")","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c73b727b-6743-add2-a45f-a83ce5b8b375"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Upcoming updates: \n## testing SVMs\n## testing decision trees","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"96c3a75c-0333-e22f-958e-036c0e0d337d"}}]}
